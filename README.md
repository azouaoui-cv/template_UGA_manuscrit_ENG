# Template for writing a thesis for the University of Grenoble Alpes
The goal of this repository is to cut out all of the hard work of using LaTeX so that one could easily write their dissertation/thesis for the Universit√© Grenoble Alpes. (Date update October 2022) 

This repository is based on the French repository: authored by David Leh and Florian Huet (docteurs au laboratoire SYMME). The packages have been updated so that it can be used with any latex editor or online service such as overleaf.

# How it works:
- The file "manuscrit.tex" (Manuscript file) is the base document.
- It is possible to modify the files for each chapter as well as edit the commands or packages within the standalone files.

# Modification of authors:
- The university logo can be edited via the "meta-donnees.sty" file.
- The PhD specialty, the lab, the doctoral school can be modified within the "meta-donnees.sty" file.
- The packages can be included within the file "packages.tex".

Note: Also within the ADUM system the cover page of the document can be generated automatically.

# Getting LaTeX Up and Running
We want to give some options such that you can be editing this Template as fast as possible. There are many different ways to run and compile these TeX files. Below will be a list of the options and how to get them set up.

Overleaf.com
This by far is the easiest way to use LaTeX. Just make an account with Overleaf and you are ready to start. There is a free version and paid version, there are differences and you may not notice them at the start. Overleaf's live preview is really nice, you can see how everything you are typing out is rendering. Potential issues of having too much content that it will take overleaf more than 3 minutes of compile time, which is the limit for the free version. If you happen to run into this, then check out running and compiling locally on your own computer.
